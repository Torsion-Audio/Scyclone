**Scyclone** is an audio plugin that utilizes **neural timbre transfer** technology to offer a new approach to audio production. This plugin builds upon [RAVE's](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE) methodology, a realtime audio variational auto encoder, facilitating neural timbre transfer in both single and couple inference mode. <br /><br />
This enables a new artificial layering technique to be applied on the incoming signal in creating richer drum pallets, fuller atmospheres or simply transferring the timbre of the raw signal to another sound pallet. To further control the behaviour and production of the neural networks, we have internally equipped the plugin with signal processings modules allowing the user to shape, control and embellish the  source and target timbres.
